        <br><h3>Final Year Project (FYP)</h3></br>
        <p> <h3> Abstrct </h3> Mobile technology is increasingly prevalent in higher education. 
		Chemistry-related software applications on touchscreen computers are emerging 
		as a popular platform in many areas, including in the chemistry classroom. 
		In this work, a new courseware-based application designed for hand-held and 
		portable touch-controlled devices is presented. This final year project introduce 
		Chem-is-Easy, an interactive learning application developed to support students in 
		learning about the Periodic Table. Periodic Table is a tabular arrangement of the 
		elements according to their atomic numbers so that elements with similar chemical 
		properties are in the same column, and is one of the fundamental topics when 
		learning Chemistry. The topic is often challenging to students as there are many
		elements there in the Periodic Table and numerous equations of elements reaction 
		formation need to be identified and understood. Further, most students have 
		constrained access to school chemistry laboratories thus limiting their opportunities 
		to conduct practical experiments beneficial to their learning. Chem-is-Easy allows 
		students to conduct lab experiments that simulates elements reaction via its lab anywhere 
		and at any time. Students also can enhance their understanding about the topics by 
		answering the questions provided at the games. With the interesting video, audio, graphics 
		and animations provided, it will make the students more interested and not boring. </p>
